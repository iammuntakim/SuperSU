features:
  - title: Kernel-based
    details: As the name suggests, SuperSU runs inside the Linux kernel, giving it more control over userspace apps.
  - title: Root access control
    details: Only permitted apps can access or see su; all other apps remain unaware of it.
  - title: Customizable root privileges
    details: SuperSU allows customization of su's uid, gid, groups, capabilities, and SELinux rules, hardening root privileges.
  - title: Metamodule system
    details: Pluggable module infrastructure allows systemless /system modifications. Install a metamodule like meta-overlayfs to enable module mounting.
